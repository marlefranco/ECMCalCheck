ECMCalCheck
===============

This project includes a simple TCP client with a graphical user interface for
displaying spectral data. The interface is loaded from a Qt Designer file and
uses a dark themed palette.  The GUI is implemented using **PyQt6** and requires
`PyQt6` and `matplotlib` to be installed.

Run the client with:

```bash
python spectro_client.py
```
