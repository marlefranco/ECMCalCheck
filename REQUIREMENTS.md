# ECMCalCheck Requirements and Recommendations

## Overview
ECMCalCheck is a TCP client application with a graphical user interface for displaying spectral data. The application connects to a server, sends commands, and visualizes the received spectral data using matplotlib.

## Current Features
- TCP client for connecting to a spectral data server
- Dark-themed GUI built with PyQt6
- Buttons for different reference measurements:
  - Dark Reference
  - White Reference
  - Attenuated White Reference
  - Mercury Reference
  - Neon Reference
  - Aiming Beam
- Real-time plotting of spectral data (wavelength vs. intensity)

## Issues and Improvement Areas

### Code Structure and Organization
1. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for network operations
   - Add reconnection capabilities
   - Provide user feedback for connection issues
   - Handle server disconnections gracefully

2. **Code Documentation**: Enhance documentation
   - Add more detailed docstrings
   - Include type hints consistently
   - Document the expected server protocol

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Move hardcoded values (IP, port, colors) to a configuration file
   - Allow command-line arguments for server connection details

### User Interface
1. **Connection Status Indicator**:
   - Add a status bar or indicator showing connection state
   - Provide visual feedback when commands are sent

2. **Data Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Add ability to save plots as images
   - Implement zooming and panning in the plot area
   - Add option to display multiple spectra for comparison
   - Include data statistics (min, max, average values)

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add tooltips for buttons explaining their function
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Add progress indicators for long operations

### Functionality
1. **Data Management**:
   - Add functionality to save received spectral data
   - Implement data export to CSV or other formats
   - Add data processing capabilities (smoothing, baseline correction)

2. **Calibration Features**:
   - Implement spectral calibration using reference spectra
   - Add wavelength calibration tools
   - Include intensity calibration options

3. **Analysis Tools**:
   - Add peak detection and labeling
   - Implement spectral comparison tools
   - Add integration and area calculation features

### Testing and Reliability
1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for UI components
   - Create a mock server for testing client behavior

2. **Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Include debug information for troubleshooting
   - Log all network communications

### Deployment
1. **Packaging**:
   - Create an installer or standalone executable
   - Include all dependencies in the package
   - Add version information and update mechanism

2. **Documentation**:
   - Expand the README with installation and usage instructions
   - Create user documentation with examples
   - Include developer documentation for future maintenance

## Priority Recommendations
1. Implement proper error handling and connection status feedback
2. Add data saving and export functionality
3. Enhance the plot with zoom/pan capabilities and multiple spectra support
4. Create a configuration system for server connection details
5. Implement basic logging for troubleshooting

## Long-term Roadmap
1. Develop advanced spectral analysis features
2. Create a plugin system for extensibility
3. Add support for different types of spectrometers
4. Implement automated calibration procedures
5. Develop a companion server application
